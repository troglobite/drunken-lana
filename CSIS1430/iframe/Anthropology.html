            This paper discuses when bipedalism appeared in evolution. it <br>
            goes into detail what the therories at the time were about why<br>
            the trait appeared and where it came from. This paper was my <br>
            first college level academic paper and therefore i am not very<br>
            proud of it but i will say it stands as a reminder as to how far<br>
            i have come.
