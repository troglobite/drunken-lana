            The course discussed, over the course of multiple movies,<br>
            culture, and more specifically the American culture. The <br>
            paper i had to write needed to discuss american culture as<br>
            it relates to film in some way. It was an intentionally broad<br>
            assignment and i choose to narrow down to how popular horror <br>
            movie topics related to overall cultural fears of the time they<br>
            were made in.
