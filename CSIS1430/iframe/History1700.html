            I had to write a paper for my American Civilazation class at the end of the semester<br>
            and I choose the technilogocal advances of the civil war. I choose it because I found<br>
            the topic very interesting. It was a very bloody war as brother fought brother and the<br>
            lengths that both sides went through to kill each other. The civil war changed warfare<br>
            forever. The paper discusses the strategy going into the war and how it changed and who<br>
            changed it.
