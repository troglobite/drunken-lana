            This is the term paper i wrote for my English 1010 class.<br>
            the class mainly focused on analyzing and crafting academic arguments.<br>
            We had various assignments throughout the semester that lead up to the <br>
            crafting of this research paper. I had very little experience writing anything <br>
            academic so this class really helped me with listening to a conversation around <br>
            a topic and adding my own voice with a carefully constructed argument.<br>
